     <p>A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.</P>
     <P>The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. </P>
     <br>
     <h1>Models</h1><br>
           <ul>
            <li>
              Common logical data models for databases include:
            </li>
           <ul>
             <li>
               Navigational databases
             </li>
           <ul>
             <li>Hierarchical database model</li>
             <li>Network model</li>
             <li>Graph database</li>
          </ul>
           </ul> </ul>
             <ul>
          <li>
               An object–relational database combines the two related structures.
             </li>
           <ul>
             <li>
               Entity–relationship model
             </li>
             <li>
               Enhanced entity–relationship model
             </li>
            </ul> 
     <br>       
     <p>While there is typically only one conceptual (or logical) and physical (or internal) view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are in the interest of the human resources department. Thus different departments need different views of the company's database.</p>
     <p> The three-level database architecture relates to the concept of data independence which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.</p>
     <p> The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Query Language</h2>
     <P>MongoDB uses MongoDB Query Language to query unstructured data from the database.</P>
     <p>SQL Server uses SQL Query Language to Create Tables, Insert, Fetch or Update data in the database.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Research</h2>  
     <p>Database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in academia and in the research and development groups of companies (for example IBM Research). 
       Research activity includes theory and development of prototypes. Notable research topics have included models, the atomic transaction concept, related concurrency control techniques, query languages and query optimization methods, RAID, and more.</p>
     <p>The database research area has several dedicated academic journals (for example, ACM Transactions on Database Systems-TODS, Data and Knowledge Engineering-DKE) and annual conferences (e.g., ACM SIGMOD, ACM PODS, VLDB, IEEE ICDE).</p>
     <br>
     <h2>External, conceptual, and internal views</h2>
     <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/47/44/af4744395b2f9487748518341ea4a4a1.png" alt="BM" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
     ,<br>
     <p>A database management system provides three views of the database data:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>The external level defines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database. A single database can have any number of views at the external level.</li>  
       <li>The conceptual level unifies the various external views into a compatible global view.It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators.</li>
       <li>The internal level (or physical level) is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such as indexes to enhance performance.</li> 
     <p>Occ,asionally it stpores data of individual views (materialized views), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. 
     It balances all the external views' performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities</p>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <h2>Building, maintaining, and tuning</h2>
     <p>After designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed user interfaces to be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the DBMS's respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).</p>
     <p>When the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application's data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.</p>
     <p>After the database is created, initialized and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (tuning) for better performance; application's data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality, etc.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Backup and restore</h2>
     <img src="https://www.cloudally.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/recover-sharepoint-file-powershell-main.png" alt="BM" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
     <p>Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Transactions and concurrency</h2>
     <p>Database transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring or releasing a lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction's programmer via special transaction commands).</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Security</h2>
     <img src="https://www.eletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cloud-main-1.jpg" alt="BM" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
     <p>Database security deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).</p>
     <p>Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) are allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.</p>
     <p>This may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and privileges to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called "subschemas". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.</p>
     <p>Data security in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see physical security), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see data encryption).</p>
     <p>Change and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic database audit later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this in the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches. Therefore, organizations must take database security seriously because of the many benefits it provides. Organizations will be safeguarded from security breaches and hacking activities like firewall intrusion, virus spread, and ransom ware. This helps in protecting the company’s essential information, which cannot be shared with outsiders at any cause.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Storage</h2>
     <p>Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, "data about the data", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Databases as digital objects contain three layers of information which must be stored: the data, the structure, and the semantics. Proper storage of all three layers is needed for future preservation and longevity of the database.[32] Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. "storage engine". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration settings are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look at the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).</p>
     <p>Some DBMSs support specifying which character encoding was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.</p>
     <p>Various low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases.</p>  
     <br>
     <h2>Database languages</h2>
     <img src="https://studyexperts.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Post-Materials-12.svg" alt="BM" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
      <p>Database languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Data control language (DCL) – controls access to data;</li>
       <li>Data definition language (DDL) – defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;</li>
       <li>Data manipulation language (DML) – performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;</li>
       <li>Data query language (DQL) – allows searching for information and computing derived information.</li>
       <p>Database languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:</p>
       <li>SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and are supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.</li>
       <li>OQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group). It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL.</li>
       <li>XQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and Db2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.</li>
       <li>SQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.</li>
   <p>A database language may also incorporate features like:</p>
       <li>DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management</li>
       <li>Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing</li>
       <li>Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)</li>
       <li>Application programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience</li>
      </ul>

 <br>
 <div class="title3">
 <p>The following section talks about the primary differences between MongoDB vs SQL Server in detail:</p>
 <br>
 <h3 id="t3.1" style="text-align:left;">Developed by and Initial Release</h3>
 <br> 
 
 <p>MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and was initially released on February 11, 2009.</p>
 <br>
 <p>SQL Server is developed by Microsoft Corporation and was initially released on April 24, 1989.</p>
 <br>
 <h3 id="t3.2" style="text-align:left;">Database Model</h3>
 <br>
 <p ></p>MongoDB is a Non-Relational Database based on a document-oriented structure that internally is based on a key-value structure.</p>
 <br>
 <p>SQL Server is a Relational Database based on relatable structured tables with various rows and columns.&nbsp;</p>
 
 <br>
 <h3 id="t3.3" style="text-align:left;">Implementation Language</h3>
 <br>
 <p>MongoDB is implemented in JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C++, C, Ruby, Perl, C, C++ whereas SQL Server is implemented in C and C++.</p>
 <br>
 <h3 id="t3.4" style="text-align:left;">License</h3>
 <br>
 <p >MongoDB is an Open-Source DBMS whereas a SQL Server license is required for commercial purposes.</p>
 
 <br>
 <h3 id="t3.5" style="text-align:left;">Data Schema</h3>
 <br>
 <p >MongoDB has a flexible dynamic schema that can easily be changed with the evolution of data, application, or business.&nbsp;</p>
 
 <br>
 <p>SQL Server has a fixed Schema that is predefined before inserting any data. Fixed schema means schema can’t be changed as data, application, or business requirement evolves.</p>
 <br>
 <h3 id="t3.6" style="text-align:left;">Query Language</h3>
 <br>
 <p>MongoDB uses MongoDB Query Language to query unstructured data from the database.</p>
 <br>
 <p>SQL Server uses SQL Query Language to Create Tables, Insert, Fetch or Update data in the database.</p>
 <br>
 
 
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>No doubt SQL Server is going strong for many years but now with the era of Big Data, MongoDB seems to have a bright future. But, that doesn’t mean SQL Server will be completely eradicated. The choice of database between MongoDB and SQL Server is completely specific to the user’s needs.</p>
